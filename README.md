# Terror Zone Tracker
Current &amp; Next Terror Zone Announcements in Discord.

Data provided thanks to [d2emu]([https://d2tz.info/](https://www.d2emu.com/tz))

Tiers are Maxroll's tiers based purely on potential XP gain, not a tier on the zone itself.

# Important
This script was specifically built to be ran in [replit](https://replit.com/) to run 24/7 for free but of course can be ran elsewhere.

Also you will need your own API token very soon to be able to use the d2tz api.
